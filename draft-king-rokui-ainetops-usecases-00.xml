      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The increasing complexity of modern networks has driven the need for innovative approaches to 
         network operations and management. Artificial Intelligence for Network Operations (AINetOps) has emerged
         as a transformative concept, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
         to automate, enhance, and optimize network management tasks. AINetOps offers the potential to 
         reduce operational costs, improve service reliability, and enhance user experiences by enabling 
         intelligent automation, predictive insights, and efficient decision-making.</t>
         
      <t>The IETF and IRTF play a critical role in defining the protocols, architectures, and standards 
         that underpin global networking. As AINetOps becomes integral to network operations, there is a 
         growing need to evaluate how existing IETF technologies can support AINetOps use cases and to 
         identify gaps that may require new or extended solutions. This document aims to outline key 
         AINetOps use cases, highlight associated technical challenges, and propose requirements for 
         protocols and architectures to address these challenges effectively.</t>   
         
      <t>The use cases considered in this document span multiple aspects of network operations, including
         reactive troubleshooting, proactive assurance (e.g., anomaly detection, predictive maintenance), 
         closed-loop optimization, and misconfiguration detection. Emerging capabilities, such as generative 
         AI for operational insights and virtual operator assistants, further emphasize the need for a 
         robust framework to support AI-driven network management. Additionally, the multi-layered nature 
         of these use cases, encompassing IP, optical, and cross-layer optimization, underscores the 
         complexity of integrating AINetOps into existing networks.</t>
         
      <t>This document provides a foundation for advancing IETF protocols and architectures to enable 
         AINetOps-driven network operations by exploring these use cases, the requirements and their implications.</t>

      <section anchor="reactive_network_assurance">
        <name>Reactive Network Assurance</name>
        <t>Reactive network assurance and troubleshooting, both at the single-layer (IP or Optical) and multi-layer (IP over Optical), are critical components in maintaining the health and stability of modern IP, Optical, and IPoDWDM networks. This process involves the identification and resolution of network issues as they arise, ensuring that any disruptions or degradations are promptly addressed. By employing AINetOps techniques, network engineers can quickly pinpoint the root cause of problems, whether they originate in the IP layer, the optical layer, or across both. This reactive approach is essential for minimizing downtime and maintaining the quality of service expected by network users.</t>
        
        <t>In single-layer troubleshooting, the focus is on isolating and resolving issues within a specific layer of the network. For example, in an IP network, this might involve diagnosing routing problems, addressing IP address conflicts, IP layer misconfiguration, hardware failure or resolving issues with network protocols. In an optical network, single-layer troubleshooting could involve identifying fiber cuts, optical signal degradation, or equipment failures</t>
        
        <t>Multi-layer troubleshooting, on the other hand, requires a more integrated approach, as it involves identifying and resolving issues that span across multiple layers of the network. This could include problems where an issue in the optical layer affects the IP layer, such as signal impairments that impact data transmission quality. By effectively managing both single-layer and multi-layer troubleshooting, network engineers can ensure a more robust and resilient network infrastructure.</t>
        
        <t>The importance of reactive assurance and troubleshooting cannot be overstated in today's high-demand network environments. Rapid response to network issues is crucial to maintaining service continuity and meeting the expectations of end-users. Advanced diagnostic tools and techniques, such as real-time monitoring, automated alerts, and detailed analytics, play a vital role in this process. These tools enable engineers to quickly detect anomalies, assess their impact, and implement corrective actions. Through continuous improvement of reactive assurance and troubleshooting practices, network operators can enhance their ability to maintain network performance, reduce operational risks, and deliver a reliable and high-quality service to their customers.</t>

        <section anchor="root_cause_analysis">
           <name>Root Cause Analysis</name>
           <t>In the context of "Reactive Network Assurance," Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a critical aspect that extends the reactive troubleshooting process to uncover the underlying reasons behind network issues. When an issue is detected in the network, RCA leverages advanced AINetOps techniques to correlate events across different layers of the network, whether it be IP, Optical, or a combination of both. This comprehensive approach ensures that the root cause of an issue is accurately identified, rather than just addressing the symptoms. Techniques such as graph-based analysis enable network engineers to visualize and trace the sequence of events leading to a problem, providing a clear pathway to the source of the issue.</t>
           
           <t>Moreover, natural language processing (NLP) for log analysis plays a significant role in RCA by automating the examination of vast amounts of log data generated by network devices. NLP can sift through logs to identify patterns and anomalies that might be missed by manual inspection. This capability is particularly useful in multi-layer networks where issues in one layer can propagate and manifest in another. By efficiently parsing through logs and correlating data, NLP helps pinpoint the exact cause of disruptions, thereby reducing the mean time to resolution (MTTR). Additionally, knowledge graph representations provide a structured and interconnected view of network components and their relationships, aiding in the rapid identification of fault points and their impact on the network.</t>
           
           <t>By accurately diagnosing the root cause of network issues, network operators can implement targeted corrective actions that address the core problem, preventing recurrence and ensuring long-term stability. This precision in troubleshooting not only minimizes downtime but also enhances the overall reliability and performance of the network. Furthermore, insights gained from RCA can inform proactive measures and optimization strategies, contributing to a more resilient network infrastructure. In essence, RCA empowers network engineers with the tools and knowledge needed to maintain high service quality and meet the demands of modern, high-performance networks.

     <section anchor="predictive_analytics">
        <name>Predictive Analytics</name>
        <t>Predictive analytics or advanced analytics uses historical and real-time network data, statistical algorithms, and ML techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on past data. In the context of network operations, predictive analytics involves the use of these methodologies in following areas to anticipate network issues, optimize performance, and improve operational efficiency. By examining patterns and trends in historical network data, predictive analytics can potentially forecast network problems before they occur, allowing for proactive management and maintenance.</t>
        
        <t>The core idea behind predictive analytics is to transform data into actionable insights. For network operations, this means analyzing various metrics such as traffic patterns, latency, performance management (PM) data, and equipment performance to predict future states of the network. For instance, by identifying trends that have historically led to network failures, predictive analytics can alert operators to potential future failures, enabling them to take preventive measures. This proactive approach helps in minimizing downtime, enhancing service reliability, and optimizing resource allocation.</t>

        <t>In summary, predictive analytics in network operations is about leveraging historical data and advanced analytical techniques to foresee and address potential issues before they impact the network. This approach leads to more efficient, reliable, and secure network operations, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and user experience. The AINetOps can address the following operator's scenarios.</t>
        
        <section anchor="proactive_network_assurance">
           <name>Proactive Network Assurance and Monitoring (Health Check)</name>
           <t>Proactive Network Assurance and Monitoring represents a paradigm shift from the reactive network assurance discussed in <xref target="reactive_network_assurance"/>. Instead of waiting for issues to arise and then addressing them, proactive network assurance involves anticipating potential problems and implementing measures to prevent them from occurring. This forward-thinking strategy leverages AINetOps to predict and mitigate network issues before they impact service quality.</t>
           
           <t>In single-layer proactive assurance, the focus is on continuously monitoring and analyzing the health of a specific layer IP or Optical layer of the network to identify early warning signs of potential issues. For instance, in an IP network, this might involve analyzing traffic patterns to detect anomalies that could indicate an impending routing problem or hardware failure. ML algorithms can be employed to predict IP address conflicts or protocol misconfigurations before they cause disruptions. Similarly, in an optical network, proactive assurance could involve monitoring signal quality and fiber integrity to detect and address degradations before they lead to significant impairments or outages.</t>
           
           <t>Multi-layer proactive assurance takes this approach a step further by integrating monitoring and analysis across both the IP and optical layers. This holistic view allows for the detection of complex issues that span multiple layers, such as optical signal impairments that could degrade IP data transmission quality. By correlating data from both layers, AINetOps solution can provide insights into how changes in the optical layer might affect IP performance and vice versa. This enables operators to take preemptive actions, such as optimizing signal paths or adjusting routing protocols, to maintain optimal network performance.</t>
           
           <t>The benefits of proactive network assurance and monitoring are substantial. By identifying and addressing potential issues before they escalate, network operators can significantly reduce downtime and improve service reliability. This proactive stance not only enhances the user experience by ensuring consistent network performance but also reduces operational costs associated with emergency troubleshooting and repairs. Furthermore, the use of advanced analytics and machine learning in AIOps allows for continuous learning and improvement, enabling networks to become more resilient and adaptive over time.</t>
           
           <t>In today's dynamic and high-demand network environments, proactive network assurance and monitoring is one of the operational benefits provided by AINetOps and are essential for staying ahead of potential issues and maintaining a competitive edge. By leveraging the power of AINetOp, network operators can transform their approach from reactive to proactive, ensuring that their networks are not only robust and resilient but also capable of delivering the high-quality service that users expect. This shift towards proactive assurance represents a significant advancement in network management, paving the way for more intelligent, efficient, and reliable network operations.</t>

        <section anchor="anomaly_detection">
           <name>Anomaly Detection</name>
           <t>A critical component of AINetOps in the context of predictive analytics is "Anomaly Detection", which leverages advanced ML algorithms to enhance network reliability and performance. By employing ML techniques such as supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning, AINetOps can predict anomalies in real-time by analyzing vast amounts of network telemetry data. Supervised learning models, trained on historical data, recognize known issues, while unsupervised models identify new anomalies by spotting outliers. This comprehensive detection mechanism ensures both familiar and novel network issues are identified promptly. Predictive models, utilizing techniques like time-series forecasting, enable the identification of potential network problems, such as link failures or traffic congestion, before they occur. By forecasting future network states based on historical and current data, these models provide early warnings, allowing for timely interventions to prevent unexpected downtime and maintain optimal performance.</t>
           
           <t>Clustering techniques further enhance anomaly detection by grouping similar data points to identify patterns and trends that signal imminent failures or suboptimal behavior. This method allows ML models to discern subtle changes in network behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, clustering can reveal traffic congestion patterns under specific conditions, enabling preemptive measures to alleviate potential issues. Additionally, clustering helps identify the root causes of anomalies by correlating various network events and metrics, facilitating a more effective troubleshooting process. By integrating these advanced ML techniques, AINetOps not only improves anomaly detection but also empowers network operators with the insights needed to maintain a high-performing and reliable network infrastructure.</t>

        <section anchor="trending_forecasting">
           <name>Trending and Forecasting</name>
           <t>"Trending and Forecasting" operational benefit is distinct but is related to "Anomaly Detection" <xref target="anomaly_detection"/>. Trending and forecasting in the context of single-layer or multi-layer IP optical networks are pivotal components of predictive analytics, providing significant operational benefits through AINetOps. In single-layer networks, such as purely IP or optical networks, trending involves analyzing historical data to identify patterns and behaviors over time. For instance, in an IP network, trends in traffic volume, latency, and packet loss can be monitored to predict future network performance and capacity needs. Similarly, in an optical network, trends in signal quality, attenuation, and equipment performance can be tracked. By leveraging these trends, predictive models can forecast potential issues such as bandwidth bottlenecks or equipment degradation, allowing network operators to proactively optimize resources, plan for upgrades, and prevent service disruptions.</t>
           
           <t>In multi-layer IP optical networks, where both IP and optical layers interact, trending and forecasting become even more powerful. This approach involves correlating data from both layers to gain a comprehensive understanding of network behavior. For example, trends in optical signal impairments can be analyzed alongside IP traffic patterns to predict how physical layer issues might impact data transmission and overall network performance. Forecasting in this multi-layer context can identify potential cross-layer issues, such as how an increase in optical signal noise might lead to higher IP packet error rates. By anticipating these issues, network operators can implement preemptive measures, such as rerouting traffic or adjusting signal parameters, to maintain seamless service. The integration of trending and forecasting through AIOps thus enhances the resilience and efficiency of IP optical networks, ensuring superior performance and reliability.

           <name>Predictive Maintenance</name>
           <t>Predictive maintenance in the context of single-layer or multi-layer IP optical networks is other aspect of predictive analytics, offering substantial operational benefits through AINeetOps. In single-layer networks, such as purely IP or optical networks, predictive maintenance involves using historical and real-time data to forecast when network components might fail or degrade. For instance, in an IP network, data from routers and switches, such as CPU usage, temperature, and error rates, can be analyzed to predict hardware failures. Similarly, in an optical network, monitoring parameters like signal strength, attenuation, and equipment performance helps predict when optical amplifiers or transceivers might need maintenance. By accurately forecasting these maintenance needs, network operators can schedule interventions before failures occur, reducing unplanned downtime and extending the lifespan of network components.</t>
           
           <t>In multi-layer IP optical networks, predictive maintenance becomes even more effective by considering the interactions between the IP and optical layers. This approach involves analyzing data from both layers to predict maintenance needs that could impact the entire network. For example, if optical layer data indicates a gradual degradation in fiber quality, predictive models can assess how this might affect IP layer performance, such as increased packet loss or latency. By understanding these cross-layer dependencies, network operators can prioritize maintenance activities that have the most significant impact on overall network health. This proactive approach ensures that both layers of the network are maintained optimally, preventing cascading failures and maintaining high service quality. Through the integration of predictive maintenance with AIOps, IP optical networks can achieve greater reliability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery to end-users.</t>

     <section anchor="network_operational_insights">
        <name>Network Operational Insights</name>
        <t>"Network Operational Insights" refers to the comprehensive visibility and understanding of an IP optical network's performance and behavior. This concept involves collecting and analyzing detailed data about the network's operations. By providing this valuable insight to network operators, they can gain a holistic view of the network's health and performance. This enables operators to understand their network better and ensure a robust and resilient infrastructure.</t>
        
        <t>By having a detailed understanding of network usage patterns, traffic flows, and performance metrics, operators can make data-driven decisions to optimize resource allocation and improve overall efficiency. This insight is particularly valuable in multi-layer IP/Optical networks, where the interplay between different network layers can be complex. By leveraging these insights, operators can ensure that both the IP and optical layers are operating harmoniously, leading to optimal performance and cost efficiency. In essence, Network Operational Insights empower operators with the knowledge needed to maintain a high-performing, resilient, and future-proof network infrastructure.
        </t>

        <t> The network operational insight can be grouped into two categories. By categorizing network operational insights into these two categories, operators can better prioritize their efforts and resources, ensuring both immediate and long-term network health and performance. </t>

        <section anchor="network_operational_insights_cat_1">
           <name>Operational Insights Requiring No Further Analysis</name>
           <t>Network Operational Insights that fall under this category are those that can be obtained directly from existing data and real-time monitoring without the need for further analysis or simulation. These insights provide immediate, actionable information that can help network operators quickly identify and address issues.</t>
           
           <t>These insights are typically derived from real-time monitoring systems that continuously track network performance and health metrics. For example, showing the Network Element (NE) with the highest alarms or displaying the current alarm table for a specific NE (e.g., NE 1.1.1.1) can provide immediate visibility into potential issues. Similarly, identifying the NEs with the highest problems during the last hour or plotting the Bit Error Rate (BER) for the 10 worst modems in a specific region (e.g., Northeast) allows operators to quickly pinpoint areas that require attention. These insights are crucial for maintaining network stability and ensuring prompt resolution of emerging issues.</t>
           
           <t>These insights also include detailed information about network components and their performance. For instance, identifying which photonic services cross a specific fiber (e.g., OTS1) or determining which modems are in use for a particular optical service (e.g., SVC-1) can help operators understand the current network configuration and its operational status. Additionally, insights such as the average time to failure for similar equipment in the network or identifying geographic regions with higher rates of network issues provide valuable context for proactive maintenance and resource planning. By leveraging these direct insights, operators can maintain a well-functioning network with minimal downtime and optimal performance.</t>
        </section> 

        <section anchor="network_operational_insights_cat_2">
           <name>Operational Insights Requiring Further Analysis</name>
           <t>Network Operational Insights in this category require deeper analysis and possibly simulation to derive meaningful conclusions. These insights often involve complex scenarios where simple monitoring data is insufficient, and further investigation is needed to understand the underlying causes or to predict future behavior.</t>
           
           <t>Insights that require investigation and simulation often involve predictive analytics and scenario planning. For example, determining whether an L0 optical service can be created between two cities (e.g., city A and Y) involves analyzing the current network topology, available resources, and potential constraints. Similarly, understanding why an IP TE-tunnel cannot be established between two points (e.g., point A and B) may require simulation of different routing scenarios and examination of network policies. These investigations help operators to not only troubleshoot current issues but also to plan and optimize future network expansions and configurations.</t>
           
           <t>These insights are crucial for long-term network health and performance optimization. Identifying the most common failure points in the network or detecting signs of degradation in wireless network performance requires a combination of historical data analysis and predictive modeling. By simulating different maintenance activities based on current network health, operators can prioritize tasks that will have the most significant impact. For instance, understanding what maintenance activities are needed based on the current network health can help in scheduling proactive maintenance that prevents future outages. These insights enable operators to take a strategic approach to network management, ensuring sustained performance and reliability over time.</t>

      <section anchor="network_config_management">
        <name>Network Configuration Management</name>
        <t>AI can assist in automating the generation and enforcement of network configurations, significantly enhancing network reliability and performance. By leveraging AI/Gen-AI algorithms, network operators can automate the creation of configuration templates that are precisely tailored to specific network requirements. These templates can encompass a wide range of settings, such as Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, Access Control Lists (ACLs), tunnel configurations, and service configuration ensuring that each network segment is optimized for its intended purpose. This automation not only speeds up the deployment process but also reduces the likelihood of human errors that can occur during manual configuration, leading to a more robust and efficient network infrastructure.</t>
        
        <t>Furthermore, AINetOps can play a role on validation of network configuration, i.e., "network configuration audit". AINetOps plays a crucial role in validating configurations against predefined network configuration, ensuring that all network setups comply with intent configuration. By continuously monitoring network configurations, AINetOps can detect and flag any deviations or misconfigurations that could pose security risks or operational inefficiencies. For example, an AI system can identify inconsistencies in ACLs that might allow unauthorized access or detect suboptimal QoS settings that could degrade service quality. By proactively addressing these issues, AINetOps helps maintain the integrity and performance of the network, enabling operators to focus on strategic initiatives rather than troubleshooting configuration errors. This proactive approach to configuration management not only enhances network security and efficiency but also supports the dynamic and scalable nature of modern network environments.</t>

     <section anchor="multi_layer_planning">
        <name>IP/Optical multi-layer Planning</name>
        <t>Multi-layer planning is an approach that integrates the planning of IP and optical networks based on traffic patterns, network simulations, and capacity planning. By analyzing these factors, IP optical network can be designed to optimize resource allocation, enhance network efficiency, and ensure the network can handle current and future demands, resulting in a more resilient and scalable infrastructure.</t>
     </section>


     <section anchor="multi_layer_optimization">
        <name>Cross-Layer and Multi-Layer Optimization</name>
        <t>AI can address the dependencies between different network layers, such as IP and optical layers, by integrating data and decision-making across these layers. 
           Multi-layer optimization algorithms ensure resource efficiency and performance by aligning the goals of individual layers, such as minimizing power consumption at 
           the physical layer while maintaining SLA guarantees at the application layer.</t>
           
           <t>Moreover, Network Operational Insights facilitate informed decision-making for network optimization and capacity planning. By having a detailed understanding of network usage patterns, traffic flows, and performance metrics, operators can make data-driven decisions to optimize resource allocation and improve overall efficiency.

     <section anchor="traffic_optimization">
        <name>Traffic Optimization</name>
        <t>Another AINetOps operational benefits is "Traffic Optimization" where IP/Optical network traffic flows can be monitored and appropriate adjustments to network protocols, network topology, network configuration, load balancing, bandwidth allocation and so on can be dynamically initiated. AINetOps traffic optimization considers multiple factors such as latency, packet loss, and link utilization, enabling networks to adapt to changing conditions in real time.</t>
        
        <t>Expanding on this, AINetOps traffic optimization leverages advanced algorithms to continuously monitor network conditions and predict potential congestion points before they impact service quality. By analyzing historical data and real-time metrics, machine learning models can forecast traffic patterns and proactively adjust routing decisions to ensure optimal performance. For instance, AINetOps can reroute traffic through less congested paths when high utilization is detected, balancing the load and enhancing overall network efficiency. This intelligent management reduces latency and packet loss while maximizing bandwidth utilization.</t>
        
        <t>Furthermore, traffic optimization enhances the network's ability to respond to sudden changes in demand, such as peak usage times or unexpected traffic spikes. Traditional static configurations may struggle with such fluctuations, leading to bottlenecks and degraded performance. With AI, the network can dynamically reconfigure itself in real-time, redistributing traffic loads and reallocating bandwidth as needed. This adaptability reduces the need for manual interventions and allows network operators to focus on strategic initiatives. In essence, AI-driven traffic optimization enables networks to be more resilient, responsive, and capable of delivering consistent high-quality service.</t>

        <t>AI can automate cleanup operations by identifying and resolving transient issues, removing redundant configurations, and optimizing resource utilization. These tasks 
           may involve the identification of "stale" network states or unused resources, enabling networks to operate more efficiently.</t>
     </section>

     <section anchor="generate_api">
        <name>Network API Construction</name>
        <t>Another significant operational benefit of implementing AINetOps in single-layer or multi-layer IP/Optical networks is the generation of various Network Controller APIs. These APIs are essential for the seamless integration of network controllers (whether IP, Optical, or multi-layer) with Operational Support Systems (OSS) or other network controllers. A key advantage of this operational benefit is that operators do not need to possess in-depth knowledge of the APIs. Typically, network operators spend considerable time creating and verifying APIs to integrate IP or Optical network elements with the broader management layer, including OSS/BSS. By developing robust and versatile APIs, network operators can ensure smooth communication and coordination between different network management systems, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency and performance</t>
        
        <t>The APIs developed for network controllers serve as a bridge, enabling the OSS to interact with the underlying network infrastructure in a more dynamic and automated manner. This integration allows for real-time data exchange, automated provisioning, and efficient fault management, which are essential for maintaining optimal network performance. Moreover, these APIs facilitate the orchestration of network resources across different layers, whether it be IP or Optical, ensuring that the network can adapt to varying demands and conditions with minimal manual intervention.</t>
        
        <t>AINetOps leverages the power of Generative AI (Gen-AI) to further enhance this integration process. By translating the operator's intent into precise network controller APIs, Gen-AI enables a more intuitive and user-friendly approach to network management. This translation capability ensures that even complex operational requirements can be seamlessly converted into actionable commands for the network controllers. This not only reduces the operational burden on network engineers but also significantly enhances the agility and responsiveness of the network to changing conditions and user demands.</t>

       <name>Network Reactive Assurance</name>
       <t>Reactive network assurance and troubleshooting, both at the single-layer (IP or Optical) and multi-layer (IP over Optical), are critical components in maintaining the health and stability of modern IP, Optical, and IPoDWDM networks. This process involves the identification and resolution of network issues as they arise, ensuring that any disruptions or degradations are promptly addressed. By employing AINetOps techniques, network engineers can quickly pinpoint the root cause of problems, whether they originate in the IP layer, the optical layer, or across both. This reactive approach is essential for minimizing downtime and maintaining the quality of service expected by network users.</t>
       
       <t>In single-layer troubleshooting, the focus is on isolating and resolving issues within a specific layer of the network. Multi-layer troubleshooting, on the other hand, requires a more integrated approach, as it involves identifying and resolving issues that span across multiple layers of the network.
